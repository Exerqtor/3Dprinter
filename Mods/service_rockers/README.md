# Voron VT & V2 Service rockers
## CHANGELOG
- 20.04.2023: Tweaked the logo a bit so it's more pronounced and the MM prints better. 
- 18.04.2023: Initial release.

###### Description:
- Since it's been a couple issues with the stock rear [WobbleX](https://github.com/MirageC79/Interfaces-for-WobbleX-integration/tree/main/Voron/Trident) Z carrier, which i have fixed for my MGN12H version i figured i could apply the same fixes to the MGN9H so that it's out there for those who need it. So here you go, enjoy!
- It's also been some issues with the pin sizes being either too small or large I've made a little test model so you can determine what suits you best. When you've found the right size for you then you choose the corresponding set of carriers & TR8 adapters.

###### Printing:
- Default voron settings (i used adaptive cubic infll @40% to save some print time), correct orientation, no supports needed!

###### Bom:
- 4x M5x8mm BHCS (or SHCS)
- 4x M5 T-slot nuts (T-nut)

###### Pictures:

###### To-do List
- Nothing that i can think of.
