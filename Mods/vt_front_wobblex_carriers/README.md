# Trident front WobbleX carriers
## CHANGELOG
- 01.05.2023: Opened up the center hole (where the leadscrew goes through) too 13mm to allow for more leadscrew movement wiithout interfering witht he carrier body.
- 26.04.2023: Variable pin sizes for WobbleX carriers, since it's been some issues with the pin sizes being either too small or large I've made a little test model so you can determine what suits you best. When you've found the right size for you then you choose the corresponding set of carriers & TR8 adapters.
- 23.04.2023: Initial release.
