###### Bom:
- 1x M3x8 Bolt and M3 T-nut
- 1x M3 T-nut
- 1x M5x10 BHCS
- 1x MR85 bearing

###### Description:
- Added a gearing at the pivot to make for smoother movement.
- Redid the PTFE path on the arm pluss widened the whole a little bit so the PTFE tube won't get squished.
- Added a flutes / design on the guide arm, mostly for looks (but it might help stiffen it a tiny bit too lol).
