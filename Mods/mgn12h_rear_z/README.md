## MGN12H rear Z carrier for Trident

###### Printing:
- Default voron settings, correct orientation, no supports needed!

###### Bom:
- Same as stock Trident except a MGN12H rail set.

###### Description:
- Modifed Voron Triden r1 rear Z carrier to house a MGN12H block instead of MGN9H.
- One version for IGUS chains (2bolt), and one version for the generic Chinese ones (3bolt).
- Rail stop that's been sized to accommodate for a MGN12 rail.
- [WobbleX](https://github.com/MirageC79/Interfaces-for-WobbleX-integration/tree/main/Voron/Trident) implementation. 

You will loose a tiny bit of Z travel, otherwise it's not much to "negative" (quite substantial loss of Z travel with WobbleX, but that's not isolated to this mod, it's just the nature of the beast).
