# CHANGELOG
- 30.11.2022: Initial release.

## MGN12H rear Z carrier for Trident

###### Printing:
- Default voron settings, correct orientation, no supports needed!

###### Bom:
- Same as stock Trident except a MGN12H rail set.

###### Description:
- Modifed Voron Triden r1 rear Z carrier to house a MGN12H block instead of MGN9H.
- One version for IGUS chains (2bolt), and one version for the generic Chinese ones (3bolt).
- Rail stop that's been sized to accommodate for a MGN12.

You will loose a tiny bit of Z travel, otherwise it's not much to "negative".

###### To-do List
- Nothing that i can think of.
