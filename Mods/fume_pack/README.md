###### Description:
Since the "fume pack" is directly dervied from "Pepe Pack v2.2" i'll only mention the changes done from that point up intil the release of "fume pack":
- Ground-up rework of the carbon container/cartridge/basket (what ever you eant to call it) to closer resemble the Nevermore Micro V5 Duo.  In other words should "fume pack" do the job exactly like a stock V5 Duo, if not better since the basket has a somewhat larger surface area of carbon for the air to pass thru.
- With the new cartridge there the carbon abmount to be used is more or less halfed compared to "pepe pack".
- Redesign of the fan lid, with deeper holes in the main body to accept 8mm bolts.

I want to point out that the fans need to be cut up to work as intended(for those who didn't know). 
- ["This is how the fans is supposed to look after cutting"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Exerqtor/Voron/main/Mods/fume_pack/pics/fancut1.png). 

Regarding cutting the fans i will try to either make a little guide, or at least a cuting guide so you can mark of where to cut them correctly.

And as allways, if you have any ideas for new features or improvement give me a ding!
