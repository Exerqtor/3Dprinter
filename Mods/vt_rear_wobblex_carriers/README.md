# Trident rear WobbleX carriers
## CHANGELOG
- 06.08.2023: Changed the Wobblex logo from an Emboss to a Deboss to better fit with the "Voron ethos", since all offical Voron logos are debossed rather than embossed.
- 01.05.2023: Opened up the center hole (where the leadscrew goes through) too 13mm to allow for more leadscrew movement wiithout interfering witht he carrier body.
- 26.04.2023: Initial release.

###### Printing:
- Default voron settings, correct orientation, no supports needed!

###### Bom:
- 1x WobbleX WS8
- Stock Voron Trident screws etc.

###### Description:
- Since it's been a couple issues with the stock rear [WobbleX](https://github.com/MirageC79/Interfaces-for-WobbleX-integration/tree/main/Voron/Trident) Z carrier, which i have fixed for my MGN12H version i figured i could apply the same fixes to the MGN9H so that it's out there for those who need it. So here you go, enjoy!
- It's also been some issues with the pin sizes being either too small or large I've made a little test model so you can determine what suits you best. When you've found the right size for you then you choose the corresponding set of carriers & TR8 adapters.
