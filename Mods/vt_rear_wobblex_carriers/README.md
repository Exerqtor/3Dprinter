# Trident rear WobbleX carriers
## CHANGELOG
- 26.04.2023: Initial release.

###### Printing:
- Default voron settings, correct orientation, no supports needed!

###### Bom:
- Same as stock Trident.

###### Description:
- Since it's been discovered a couple issues with the stock rear [WobbleX](https://github.com/MirageC79/Interfaces-for-WobbleX-integration/tree/main/Voron/Trident) Z carrier that I've already fixed for my MGN12H version i figured i could apply the same fixes to the MGN9H so that it's out there for those who need it. So here you go, enjoy!
- It's also been some issues with the pin sizes being either too small or large I've made a little test model so you can determine what suits you best. When you've found the right size for you then you choose the corresponding set of carriers & TR8 adapters.
