# Trident rear WobbleX carriers
## CHANGELOG
- 26.04.2023: Initial release.

###### Printing:
- Default voron settings, correct orientation, no supports needed!

###### Bom:
- Same as stock Trident except a MGN12H rail set.

###### Description:
- Since it's been discovered a couple issues with the stock rear [WobbleX](https://github.com/MirageC79/Interfaces-for-WobbleX-integration/tree/main/Voron/Trident) Z carrier that I've already fixed for my MGN12H version i figured i could apply the same fixes to the MGN9H so that it's out there for those who need it. So here you go, enjoy!
