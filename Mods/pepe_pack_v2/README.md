## Pepe Pack "v2.2"
##### Credits:
- smooshworx here on gitub made a ["mod of the fanny/funny pack,"](https://github.com/smooshworx/pepe-pack), and i've done some further work on it together with him.

###### Printing:
- Default voron settings, correct orientation, no supports needed!

###### Bom:
- 15x M3x8mm BHCS - if you choose to use all the mounting points!
- 15x M3x5x4mm Heat sets - if you choose to use all the mounting points!
- 8x 6x3mm Magnets - to hold the basket

###### Description:
- Added two new cable chanels that tuck in right under the rear extrusion on a Trident..
- Totally re-worked the drill template so that it's more printer and OCD friendly, with the added holes for those who want to use "my" cable channels.
- Added side entry PTFE coupling points.
- Fixed some issues with the CAD for the main housing.
- Added gaskets around the fan inlets (optional).
- Extensive rework of the basket grills, and some tweaking to the basket lid.
- Added holes to screw the fans down to the main body.
- Added "Prusa-style" overhangs for bolt mounts.
- Added a "5-bolt" version, removing (objectively) unneeded mounting bolts.
- Removed the "gussets" on the outside of the main body.
- Altered the fillets and chamfers on main body to fit the Voron design aestetic somewhat better (imo).
- Added some "lips" to the main body to better cover up the hole in the back panel (somewhat like the original exhaust housing).
- "Blocked" off all external wire passages with a cutaway piece and reworked the channeling for the wires.
- Widened the "fins" above the fans to make them more printable.
- Adjusted the hole size for the magnets so they don't fall out.
- Lots of small stuff i've forgot by now.
