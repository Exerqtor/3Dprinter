# UPDATE
- 16.07.2022: Initial release, this is NOT the finished or polished "product" but it works! I will update the design and publish the CAD (with updated STL's ofc) as soon as i can!
This is ONLY for the left side on a 350mm Trident!

## Revo nozzle storage skirt
##### Credits:
- Voron Discord channel user Andre#7463 (So I says...), he was the one who made the initial design and supplied the CAD that i worked of for the skirt part.
- His Design is made for GE5C and Igus ELGM-05
- He inspired me for this here and many more things :-)

###### Printing:
- Default voron settings, correct orientation, no supports needed!

###### Bom:
- 2x M3x8 SHCS
- 2x 6x3 Magnets

###### Description:
- The whole reason for this is, that GE5C bearings have some play in them. Igus ELGM05 are a lot better, but i wanted something Gucci and even stiffer with more tilting.
- Misumi mentions in the specsheets max 0,035mm axial play. Igus and GE5C have no axial play specifications. (But igus have actually no play)
- This means for me, that with some Grease (Mobilux EP1/EP2), should remove almost all play and the uneven Gantry (it will always press the bearings outside/inside), will do the rest.

###### Update:
- After a lot of iterations and a lot of headaches, its finally done. Now i can finally tell the difference, why you probably want to do this either: you will get a lot stiffer gantry that is able to tilt freely.
- ADXL tests will follow, need to fix my printer first again, my accelerations made some screws and inserts falling out xD
