# Macros

## Manually called macros
- This is the macros i use, i generally try to keep these "manually called" ones to a bare minimum.

#### Use
- Alle these ones are without file extensions but are essentially .g files, the reason they are extension-less is to keep
DWC and PanelDue looking tidier.  Just treat and edit them as .g files but save without adding an extension!
